Extract a listing of all commenter emails.


== Description ==

Extract a listing of all commenter emails.

Via the admin page added by the plugin, `Comments -> Commenter Emails`, the admin is presented with the following information:

* A total count of all unique commenters to the blog
* A button to download the entire list of unique commenters' email addresses in CSV (comma-separated values) format
* The entire list of unique commenters' email addresses

The plugin only considers approved comments and does not exclude from its listing any known emails (i.e. admin and post author emails).
